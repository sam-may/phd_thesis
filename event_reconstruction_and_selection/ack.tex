The figures shown in Chapter 5 are taken from the following publications: ``Performance of Photon Reconstruction and Identification with the CMS Detector in Proton-Proton Collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV'', \emph{Journal of Instrumentation} (2015), ``Jet energy scale and resolution in the CMS experiment in pp collisions at 8 TeV'', \emph{Journal of Instrumentation} (2017), ``Identification of heavy-flavour jets with the CMS detector in pp collisions at 13 TeV'', \emph{Journal of Instrumentation} (2018), and ``Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV'', \emph{CMS-PAS-HIG-19-015} (2020), and were produced by other members of the CMS Collaboration, particularly those involved in the CMS Higgs to Gamma Gamma working group.
