Neutrinos and other weakly interacting particles cannot be directly detected by the CMS detector.
Instead, their presence must be inferred through the presence of missing transverse momentum, \ptmiss (often colloquially denoted as \met).
The \met in the event is first computed as the negative vector sum of all of the PF candidates in the event.
The \met is then corrected according to the jet energy corrections for all of the jets in the event.
%\begin{equation}
%    \ptmiss = \met = \sum_{\text{PF cands.}} 
%\end{equation}
