The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a hadron accelerator and collider located in a 27km underground tunnel on the French-Swiss border, near Geneva.
While the LHC supports both proton and lead (Pb) ion beams, this dissertation focuses on results obtained with data from proton-proton collisions~\cite{Evans_2008}.
