%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%

  Heartfelt dedication.

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if

%% ABSTRACT
%
%  Doctoral dissertation abstracts should not exceed 350 words.
%   The abstract may continue to a second page if necessary.
%
\begin{abstract}
  This dissertation presents the first observation of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark-antiquark pair in the diphoton decay channel, with a significance of 6.6 standard deviations.
  The measurement is performed with a dataset of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 \fbinv.
