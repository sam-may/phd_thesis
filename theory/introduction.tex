Start with motivation for QFT.
Explain basics of QFT.
Explain SM.
Focus on electroweak symmetry breaking, Higgs mechanism, etc.
What are the shortcomings of the SM?
These motivate the existence of physics beyond SM.
How can we push the limits of SM and search for new physics at the LHC?
How does measuring ttH help in this effort?
