Chapter 6 describes the \ttH analysis documented in ``Measurements of $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$H production and the CP structure of the Yukawa interaction between the Higgs boson and top quark in the diphoton decay channel'' \emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} 125 (2020), with a focus on the aspects to which I contributed most directly, but relies heavily from the work of other members of the CMS Collaboration and the CMS Higgs to Gamma Gamma working group, without whom this analysis would not have been possible.
My primary individual contributions to this work included the following: implementation of the data-driven description of multi-jet and $\gamma$ + jet backgrounds, studies of agreement between data and simulation, training and optimization of the deep neural networks and boosted decision trees used for signal region definition, and implementation of some systematic uncertainties.
Figures~\ref{fig:tth_sig_model},\ref{fig:tth_bkg_functions}, and~\ref{fig:tth_bkg_models} show the results of the signal and background models for the \ttH analysis, and were produced by Hualin Mei.
Figure~\ref{fig:tth_impacts} shows the impact of systematic uncertainties on the measurement of $\mu_{\ttH}$, and was produced by Hualin Mei.
Figures~\ref{fig:tth_obs_sr_weighted} and~\ref{fig:tth_llr} show the observed results of the \ttH analysis, and were also produced by Hualin Mei.
Figure~\ref{fig:tth_cp} shows the result of the \ttH CP measurement and was produced by Meng Xiao.
