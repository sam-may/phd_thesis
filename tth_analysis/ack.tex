The entire CMS Higgs to Gamma Gamma group helped immensely in developing nearly every facet of this analysis, and its completion would not have been possible without the tremendous collective effort from the group.

Figures~\ref{fig:tth_sig_model},\ref{fig:tth_bkg_functions}, and~\ref{fig:tth_bkg_models} show the results of the signal and background models for the \ttH analysis, and were produced by Hualin Mei.

Figure~\ref{fig:tth_impacts} shows the impact of systematic uncertainties on the measurement of $\mu_{\ttH}$, and was produced by Hualin Mei.

Figures~\ref{fig:tth_obs_sr_weighted} and~\ref{fig:tth_llr} show the observed results of the \ttH analysis, and were also produced by
Hualin Mei.

Figure~\ref{fig:tth_cp} shows the result of the \ttH CP measurement and was produced by Meng Xiao.
